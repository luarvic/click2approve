        <h2>How to send documents for approval</h2>
        <p>
          Sending documents for approval means that you are requesting the
          approvers to review the documents and approve or reject the request.
          The documents sent to the approvers will be accessible only to them
          and to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Open the <i>FILES</i> tab, select the files you want to send for
          approval, and click the <i>SEND</i> button.
        </p>
        <img src="/ui/public/images/send-files-1.png" alt="Send files" />
        <p>
          In the dialog that appears, enter the email address of the approver
          and press <i>Enter</i>. Optionally, specify a <i>Review by</i> date
          and time, and enter a comment for the approvers. Click the
          <i>SUBMIT</i> button to send the documents for approval.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/ui/public/images/send-files-2.png"
          alt="Approval request submission"
        />
        <p>
          All approvers will receive an email notification with instructions on
          how to review and approve the documents you sent them.
        </p>
        <p>
          To track an approval request, go to the <i>SENT</i> tab, click the
          ellipsis button next to the request, and choose the
          <i>Track</i> action.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/ui/public/images/sent-files-1.png"
          alt="Track approval request"
        />
        <p>
          Once the request is approved, you will be notified via email, and the
          dialog will show the approval status with comments and timestamps.
        </p>
